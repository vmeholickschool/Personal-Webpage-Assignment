        <h2>My passions</h2>
        <p>When I am not working or attending bootcamp, I enjoy spending time around the house working on home
            improvements
            and caring for my 4 dogs and 2 cats and playing pinball on my Arcade 1up machine. I also usually have a
            foster dog in the house as I spend a lot of time
            volunteering for animal rescue groups advocating for animal rights and finding abandoned dogs their
            forever
            homes. Animal Rescue has been my greatest passion for the past 6 years. My favorite Musician is Chris
            Cornell, I love Tattoos and I love going to concerts.</p>

        <h3>My future goals</h3>
        <p>I would love to do some international travel to Europe. Greece and Italy are bucket list places. I would
            like
            to
            continue to grow my skills in technology and I am planning on continuing to foster dogs and cats but
            mostly
            senior animals as they do not belong in a shelter.</p>
